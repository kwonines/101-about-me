            I'm really smart, good looking, and interesting, so it's no surprise you want to learn all about me.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            You're probably wondering how I got so smart. Turns out, I went to college. Three different colleges actually. First, I went to the best community college out there, San Joaquin Delta College, because it was free. Once I got too smart for community college, I went to BYU-Idaho, because it's easy to get into. Once I got too smart for BYU-Idaho, I came here to BYU. Pretty soon I'll be too smart for here, and I'll go start my own university. I'll name it something like Academy for Knowledge, or Louisiana Institue of General and Modern Arts.
        </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
            You're probably also wondering why I look so good. Well, some say that my dashing looks come from my parents. I'll leave that for you to decide. It should be pretty easy to tell once you see them:

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, you're probably wondering why I'm so interesting. Well, it all comes down to hobbies. I probably have the best hobbies you've ever heard of. First, sky-skiing. That's where I jump out of a plane but instead of just falling down I ski down the clowds. I'm so good I stopped bringing a parachute. 
            <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Here's a video of me doing it</a></em><br><br>
            
            Second, snow-diving. That's where I go down a snowy mountain slope, but instead of just tumbling or sliding down, I actually gracefully fall into the snow, the burrow into the rock. I go down the whole mountain while diving through the snow and rock. You might be wondering how I dive through solid rock. Basically, I'm so cool that the rock moves out of the way for me.
